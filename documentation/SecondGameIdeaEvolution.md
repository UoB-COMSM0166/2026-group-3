# Evolution Through Consumption 

Evolution Through Consumption is a growth-based evolution game where progression is driven by consuming weaker entities to unlock entirely new forms. The focus of the game is on transforming into fundamentally different forms that change how the player interacts with the world.

Core Gameplay Loop:
Explore the environment
→ Consume weaker entities
→ Accumulate evolution energy
→ Reach evolution threshold
→ Unlock a new form
→ World rules and interactions change
→ Continue exploration in the new form

Evolution stages:
Stage 1 – Primitive Cell:
A fragile single-cell organism that can only absorb basic nutrients and is the weakest
micro-organisms.
The player learns the core loop safely: approach, consume, retreat.
Larger cells or predators are instant threats, forcing careful movement and positioning.
Stage 2 – Specialised Cell:
After reaching an evolution threshold, the organism differentiates into a specialised
form.
Example specialisations:
- Muscle Cell: faster movement and stronger absorption power, enabling aggressive
play.
- Nerve Cell: wider detection range and quicker reaction, enabling safer scouting and
avoidance.
- Armour Cell: slower but more resistant, enabling exploration in riskier zones.
This stage expands both ability options and accessible areas.
Stage 3 – Elemental Form:
The organism evolves beyond biology and gains an elemental property that changes
interaction rules.
Example elemental forms:
- Fire Form: consumes organic entities quickly but loses energy over time (time
pressure).
- Ice Form: slows nearby threats and hazards, improving control at the cost of speed.
- Electric Form: enables rapid traversal and chain effects during consumption, but
movement becomes less stable.
This stage delivers the “world rules change” moment through clear, visible mechanics.
