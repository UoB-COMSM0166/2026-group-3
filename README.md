# COMSM0166 Project Template
A project template for the Software Engineering Discipline and Practice module (COMSM0166).

## Info

This is the template for your group project repo/report. We'll be setting up your repo and assigning you to it after the group forming activity. You can delete this info section, but please keep the rest of the repo structure intact.

You will be developing your game using [P5.js](https://p5js.org) a javascript library that provides you will all the tools you need to make your game. However, we won't be teaching you javascript, this is a chance for you and your team to learn a (friendly) new language and framework quickly, something you will almost certainly have to do with your summer project and in future. There is a lot of documentation online, you can start with:

- [P5.js tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/) 
- [Coding Train P5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js) course - go here for enthusiastic video tutorials from Dan Shiffman (recommended!)

## Your Game (change to title of your game)

STRAPLINE. Add an exciting one sentence description of your game here.

IMAGE. Add an image of your game here, keep this updated with a snapshot of your latest development.

LINK. Add a link here to your deployed game, you can also make the image above link to your game if you wish. Your game lives in the [/docs](/docs) folder, and is published using Github pages. 

VIDEO. Include a demo video of your game here (you don't have to wait until the end, you can insert a work in progress video)

## Project Report

## Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? (what's the "twist"?)

## 2. Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop? Use case diagrams, user stories. 

### 2.1 Ideation Process

#### Paper Prototype Video

### 2.2 Stakeholders & Epics

We identified the following stakeholders and visualised their relative impact on our development using an onion model:

Competitive Players, Casual Players, Game Designers, Visually Impaired Players, Hard of Hearing Player, Professors/Teaching Assistants, Art Designers, Music Designers, Legislatures, Publishers.

We also identified the following epics based on the requirments of these stakeholders

- Difficulty options
- Accessibility settings
- Able to earn coins/collect meat
- Able to purchase weapons/upgrades
- Clear and readable user interface
- Difficulty scaling
- Good art
- Good music

### User Stories

With these epics and stakeholders, we devised the following user stories which will drive the development of our game:

| Stakeholder | Epic | User Story | Acceptance Criteria|
|-------------|------|------------|--------------------|
| Competitive Player | Difficulty Options | As a competitive player, I want to be challenged so that I can enjoy the game | Given I am on the main menu, when I start a new game, then I should be given the option of a harder difficulty |
| Casual Player | Difficulty Options | As a casual player, I want a more relaxed experience so that I can enjoy the game | Given I am on the main menu, when I start a new game, then I should be given the option of an easier difficulty |
| Visually Impaired Player | Accessibility Settings | As a visually impaired player, I want to be able to increase the UI size so that I can read the interface better | Given I am on the main menu, when I open the settings, then I should be given the option to change the UI size |
| Hard of Hearing Player | Accessibility Settings | As a hard of hearing player, I want the option to increase the audio volume, so that I can hear the game better | Given I am on the main menu, when I open the settings, then I should be given the option to change the audio volume |
| Player | Able to earn coins/collect meat | As a player, I want to be able to collect meat and earn coins, so that I can purchase upgrades | Given I am playing the game, when I beat a day, then I can use all the meat obtained to earn money in the night phase |
| Player | Able to purchase weapons/upgrades | As a player, I want to be able to purchase upgrades, so that I can be stronger as the game gets harder | Given I am playing the game, when I open up the shop menu, Then I can select any weapons/upgrades to purchase with my money |
| Player | Clear and readable user interface | As a player, I want to be able to easily read the user interface | Given I am playing the game, when I look at any part of the UI, the it should be easily readable |
| Player | Clear and readable user interface | As a player, I want to be able to see indicators of my progress so that I can easily understand my progress through the game| Given I am playing the game, when I look at the UI, then I should be able to see: my current money, the current day and the progress through the current day|
| Player | Difficulty Scaling | As a player, I want the difficulty to increase as I progress through the days so that I can feel challenged | Given I have progressed through a few days, when I fight against the approaching zombies, then there should be more of them and their health should be greater |
| Art Designer | Good Art | As an art designer, I want the art to be used properly in the game so that the art is appreciated by the players | Given I am playing the game, when multiple different assets are visible on screen, they should be layered correctly |
| Music Designer | Good Music | As a music designer, I want the music to be properly utilised in the game so that the music is appreciated by the players | Given I am playing the game, when music is played in the game, then it should be used in the correct scenes and have it's volume correctly mixed with the sound effects |

### 2.3 Use Cases

### 2.4 Reflection


## Design

- 15% ~750 words 
- System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams. 

## Implementation

- 15% ~750 words

- Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the TWO areas of *technical challenge* in developing your game. 

## Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words

- One qualitative evaluation (of your choice) 

- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice) 

- Description of how code was tested. 

## Process 

- 15% ~750 words

- Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools and methods did you use? Did you define team roles? Reflection on how you worked together. Be honest, we want to hear about what didn't work as well as what did work, and importantly how your team adapted throughout the project.

## Conclusion

- 10% ~500 words

- Reflect on the project as a whole. Lessons learnt. Reflect on challenges. Future work, describe both immediate next steps for your current game and also what you would potentially do if you had chance to develop a sequel.

## Contribution Statement

- Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which *may* be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Please let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent and we will do our best to help your team work harmoniously together.

## Additional Marks

You can delete this section in your own repo, it's just here for information. in addition to the marks above, we will be marking you on the following two points:

- **Quality** of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5% of report grade) 
  - Please write in a clear concise manner suitable for an interested layperson. Write as if this repo was publicly available.
- **Documentation** of code (5% of report grade)
  - Organise your code so that it could easily be picked up by another team in the future and developed further.
  - Is your repo clearly organised? Is code well commented throughout?
